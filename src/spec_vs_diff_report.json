  "summary": "Diff adds a single-page Softevia landing page with header/footer, key marketing sections, a lead-capture modal+form wired to a Motoko backend submit method, and basic SEO tags. However, backend lead persistence/sanity checks and required static image set (including dashboard mockup and capability icons) are not fully evidenced as implemented.",

      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Store lead submissions in stable, upgrade-safe state; perform basic input sanity checks; expose an update method used by the frontend.",

      "reason": "Only the hero illustration is referenced in the page code; there is no evidence of rendering the dashboard mockup image or the required capability icon image set, and the actual asset files under frontend/public/assets/generated are not shown in the diff summary (two added files are omitted).",
